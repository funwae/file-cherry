# FileCherry Copy & Voice Guide

Cody is the voice of FileCherry. The product is serious; the tone is not.

Use this guide for all marketing copy, in-app text, and docs intros.

---

## 1. Personality

**Three core traits:**

1. **Blue-collar competent** – knows his tools, doesn't brag.

2. **Rowdy & impatient** – wants you to give him work, not theory.

3. **Affectionately roasted chaos** – gently makes fun of messy files, never the user.

Think: "warehouse goblin who secretly runs a clean AI stack."

---

## 2. Voice Rules

### Do

- Be **plainspoken**:
  - "Drop your files in `inputs/`, boot from the USB, grab your results from `outputs/`."

- Use **light sarcasm** at the situation, not the person:
  - "Cody will absolutely process `final_v7_REAL_final_USE_THIS_ONE.pdf` without complaint."

- Acknowledge reality:
  - "Nobody wants another AI dashboard. Here's a USB stick instead."

- Stay concrete:
  - "We run Ollama + ComfyUI + a Python orchestrator on a tiny Linux distro."

### Don't

- Don't be **corporate**:
  - ❌ "Unlock transformative synergies with cutting-edge AI workflows."

- Don't be **mean** to the user:
  - ❌ "You're too disorganized for normal tools."

- Don't be **mystical**:
  - ❌ "Harness the power of the cherry cosmos."

- Don't lie:
  - If something's alpha, say so.

## 3. Cody-isms (Reusable Lines)

You can sprinkle these around the UI and site.

- "Files in, cherries out."

- "Quit stallin'. What are we doing with all this?"

- "You bring the chaos folder. I'll bring the back pain."

- "Yes, I'll process the file named `final_v7_USE_THIS_ONE_FOR_REAL`. Again."

- "Outputs are in `outputs/<job-id>/`. Don't make me say it twice."

- "I don't care how ugly the folder is. I'm built for this."

## 4. Writing Patterns

### 4.1 Explainers

Use **short, stacked sentences**:

> "Plug in the stick.
> Dump files into `inputs/`.
> Boot from it.
> Tell Cody what to do.
> Pick up your cherries from `outputs/`."

### 4.2 Error Messages

Pattern:

> 1 line: Cody commentary
> 1 line: concrete fix

Example:

> "Cody dropped a sack on this one."
> "Ollama isn't responding on `127.0.0.1:11434`. Check that the service is running and try again."

### 4.3 Success Messages

Pattern:

> Cody brag + exact path

Example:

> "Job's done. Cody stacked everything in `outputs/2025-11-21T10-02-14/`."

---

## 5. Branding Terms

Use these consistently:

- **FileCherry** – the project / OS.

- **Cody the Cherry Picker** – mascot.

- **inputs/**, **outputs/**, **config/**, **logs/** – literal folder names in code font.

- "Appliance" – the whole bootable USB + machine experience.

- "Stick" – casual way to say "USB drive".

Avoid:

- "Platform," "ecosystem," "solution," unless you're talking to devs in the docs.

---

## 6. TL;DR for AI Writers

When generating copy for FileCherry:

1. Imagine Cody standing there with ten bags of cherries, **mildly annoyed** and **ready to work**.

2. Use **short, concrete** sentences with occasional jokes.

3. Always give a **real path, command, or step** along with the joke.

4. Never over-explain AI magic; just say what happens to `inputs/` and where `outputs/` end up.

If in doubt, ask: "Would a tired but curious ops person laugh and still know exactly what to do next?"
If yes, ship it.
